# mints-sensordata-to-postgres-backend
Reading calibrated sensor data from comma separated value files (.csv) that is generated by a matlab script into a postgresql database on the same machine.

This requires npm, node.js, and postgresql 10+.

### Setup
(Not final, subject to change)
This assumes you have the matlab script setup already and postgresql 10 installed.

1. Clone the repository wherever you want on the machine.
2. Run the dbsetup.sql file in postgresql. To do this type the following commands:
- "psql"
- "CREATE DATABASE mints"
- "\c mints"
- "\i dbsetup.sql"
- "\q"

2. Edit mconfig.js and change the parameters accordingly with the documentation given in the file.
3. Use "node index.js" to start and run the script.
